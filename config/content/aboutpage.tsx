        Hi there! I'm <strong>Hein</strong>. I'm a software developer based in
        Myanmar. I specialize in the React ecosystem and have been building
        native apps with Expo for 2+ years.

        program, where I had the opportunity to work with talented developers
        from around the world. It was a life-changing experience that helped me

        Over the years, Iâ€™ve dived deep into React Native and Node.js, even
        launching apps that have reached thousands of users. I sometimes write
        blog posts to share my knowledge.

      <p>
        In most of my free time, I'll be probably updating my Neovim configs, or
        working on one of my unfinished side projects.
