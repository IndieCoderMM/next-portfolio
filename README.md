## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

git clone https://github.com/indiecodermm/stellar-portfolio.git
cd stellar-portfolio
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Copy the example env file and add your own config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. **Run the dev server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. **Open Sanity Dashboard**

Once the app is running, you can access the Sanity Studio at [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) to manage your content.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to add your data to the Sanity dataset before deploying or using the site.

## Customization

All page content can be modified in the `/config/` folder.

_No need to dig into components unless you want to._

## Content Management (Sanity)

This template is integrated with [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/) for flexible content editing.

- You can manage projects, skills, and other dynamic content through the Sanity dashboard.
- The Sanity Studio is available at `/dashboard` once the project is running.
- To set it up:
  1. Create a project at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
  2. Copy the project ID and dataset name into your `.env.local` file
  3. Run both frontend and Sanity Studio locally, or deploy them together

You can also customize the schema or extend it for additional content types as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change the refresh frequency, customize `contentRefreshInterval` in `/config/index.ts` to set how often the content is fetched from Sanity. _Default is 3600 seconds (1 hr)._

## Contact Form

The contact form uses **EmailJS** for sending messages.

- Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- Create a service and connect it to an email account
- Create an email template for the contact form.
